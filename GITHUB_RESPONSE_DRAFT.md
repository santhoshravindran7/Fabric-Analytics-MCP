# GitHub Issues #2 and #3 Response Draft

## Issue Summary
Both Patrick and Steve reported similar authentication timeout issues when trying to use the Microsoft Fabric Analytics MCP server with Claude Desktop. The server would hang for 60 seconds during initialization before timing out.

## Resolution

Hi @Patrick and @Steve,

Thank you for reporting this issue! I've identified and fixed the authentication blocking problem in Claude Desktop. 

### Problem Analysis
The issue was caused by interactive authentication flows (device code, interactive, service principal) blocking the MCP server initialization process in Claude Desktop's sandboxed environment. When the server attempted to authenticate using these methods, it would prevent Claude Desktop from completing the MCP handshake, resulting in the 60-second timeout you experienced.

### âœ… **Fix Implemented (Phase 1)**

I've just pushed a fix that includes:

1. **Timeout Protection**: Authentication attempts now have a 10-second timeout to prevent blocking
2. **Enhanced Bearer Token Support**: Prioritizes `FABRIC_TOKEN` environment variable 
3. **Better Error Messages**: Clear guidance when authentication fails in Claude Desktop
4. **Graceful Fallback**: Automatically switches to simulation mode if authentication fails

### ðŸš€ **Recommended Solution for Claude Desktop**

Use bearer token authentication instead of interactive flows:

#### Update your `claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fabric-analytics": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["C:\\path\\to\\your\\build\\index.js"],
      "env": {
        "FABRIC_AUTH_METHOD": "bearer_token",
        "FABRIC_TOKEN": "your_bearer_token_here",
        "FABRIC_DEFAULT_WORKSPACE_ID": "your_workspace_id"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### How to Get a Bearer Token:
1. Visit https://app.powerbi.com/embedsetup
2. Select your workspace and generate a token
3. Copy the token to your config

#### Alternative (Per-Tool Token):
You can also provide tokens directly when calling tools:
```
Tool Parameter: bearerToken: "your_bearer_token_here"
```

### ðŸ”§ **What Changed**

- **Authentication flows no longer block** during server startup
- **FABRIC_TOKEN environment variable** is now prioritized
- **Better error handling** with Claude Desktop-specific guidance
- **Backward compatibility** maintained for other environments

### ðŸ“‹ **Next Steps**

1. **Update to latest version**: `git pull` the latest changes
2. **Rebuild the server**: `npm run build`
3. **Update your config** with bearer token method
4. **Test with Claude Desktop**

### ðŸ›  **Testing the Fix**

The server will now:
- âœ… Start quickly without authentication delays
- âœ… Provide helpful error messages if authentication fails
- âœ… Fall back to simulation mode for testing
- âœ… Work seamlessly with bearer tokens

### ðŸ“š **Documentation**

I've added comprehensive documentation in `CLAUDE_DESKTOP_FIX.md` that covers:
- Technical details of the fix
- Step-by-step setup instructions
- Troubleshooting guidance
- Future enhancement plans

### ðŸš€ **Future Enhancements (Phase 2)**

I'm planning additional improvements:
- Automatic token refresh handling
- Enhanced simulation responses
- Claude Desktop-specific optimizations
- Better token validation

Please try the updated version and let me know if you encounter any issues. The authentication timeout problem should now be resolved!

Thanks again for the detailed reports - they were instrumental in identifying and fixing this issue.

**Resolution Status**: âœ… **FIXED** - Authentication timeout blocking resolved
**Affected Versions**: All versions prior to this fix
**Recommended Action**: Update to latest version and use bearer token authentication
