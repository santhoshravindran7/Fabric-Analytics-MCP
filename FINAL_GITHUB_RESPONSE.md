## 🎯 **Ready-to-Post GitHub Response for Issues #2 & #3**

Hi @Patrick and @Steve! 👋

Thank you for reporting the authentication timeout issue with Claude Desktop! I've successfully identified and **fixed the root cause**. The 60-second hangs you experienced are now resolved.

## 🔍 **Problem Analysis**
The issue was caused by **interactive authentication flows blocking the MCP server initialization** in Claude Desktop's sandboxed environment. Here's what was happening:

1. **Claude Desktop starts the MCP server** and expects a quick handshake
2. **Server attempts authentication** using device code/interactive/service principal flows
3. **Authentication blocks** waiting for user interaction that can't happen in the sandboxed environment
4. **Claude Desktop times out** after 60 seconds, exactly as you reported

This affected **all non-bearer token authentication methods** but didn't impact other environments like terminal usage.

## ✅ **FIXED - Solution Implemented**

I've just pushed a comprehensive fix that includes:

### **Phase 1: Core Authentication Fix**
- ✅ **10-second timeout protection** - Prevents blocking authentication flows
- ✅ **Enhanced bearer token support** - Prioritizes `FABRIC_TOKEN` environment variable
- ✅ **Graceful fallback** - Auto-switches to simulation mode if auth fails
- ✅ **Clear error messages** - Provides actionable guidance for Claude Desktop

### **Phase 2: Additional Enhancements** 
- ✅ **JWT token validation** - Checks token format and expiration
- ✅ **Smart token handling** - Warns about expired/expiring tokens
- ✅ **Enhanced health endpoint** - Authentication status monitoring
- ✅ **Better error guidance** - Links to token generation tools

## 🚀 **Recommended Solution**

**Use bearer token authentication** - this completely bypasses the interactive flows that were causing the blocking:

### **Step 1: Update your `claude_desktop_config.json`**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fabric-analytics": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["C:\\path\\to\\your\\build\\index.js"],
      "cwd": "C:\\path\\to\\your\\project",
      "env": {
        "FABRIC_AUTH_METHOD": "bearer_token",
        "FABRIC_TOKEN": "your_bearer_token_here",
        "FABRIC_WORKSPACE_ID": "your_workspace_id",
        "ENABLE_HEALTH_SERVER": "false"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### **Step 2: Generate a Fresh Bearer Token**
1. 🌐 Visit **https://app.powerbi.com/embedsetup**
2. 🎯 Select your target workspace
3. 📋 Copy the generated bearer token
4. ⚙️ Update your Claude Desktop config

> **Important:** Tokens expire! The sample token in config files typically expires after 1 hour. You'll need to refresh periodically.

## 🧪 **Testing the Fix**

### **Step 3: Update to Latest Version**
```bash
git pull origin master
npm run build
```

### **Step 4: Restart Claude Desktop**
- Close Claude Desktop completely
- Restart the application
- The MCP server should now connect without timeouts!

### **Step 5: Verify Everything Works**
Try any of these commands in Claude Desktop:
```
• "List my Fabric workspaces"
• "Show items in my workspace" 
• "Create a new lakehouse called TestLH"
```

## 🔧 **What Changed Technically**

### **Before (Causing Timeouts):**
```
Claude Desktop → MCP Server → getAuthToken() → [BLOCKS ON AUTH] → 60s timeout
```

### **After (Fixed):**
```
Claude Desktop → MCP Server → Quick startup ✅
First API call → Check FABRIC_TOKEN → Use immediately ✅
```

### **Key Technical Improvements:**
- **Non-blocking startup**: Server initializes immediately without authentication
- **Smart token prioritization**: `FABRIC_TOKEN` > cached tokens > auth flows
- **Timeout protection**: 10-second limit prevents hanging
- **Token validation**: Checks JWT format and expiration
- **Better diagnostics**: Health endpoint shows auth status

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

### **Token Management:**
- Tokens typically expire after **1 hour** 
- Our enhanced system now **warns you** when tokens are about to expire
- Set up a **bookmark** to https://app.powerbi.com/embedsetup for easy token refresh

### **Alternative Method - Environment Variable:**
Instead of putting the token in Claude config, you can set:
```bash
set FABRIC_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

### **Simulation Mode (For Testing):**
If you want to test without a real token:
```
bearerToken: "simulation"
```
